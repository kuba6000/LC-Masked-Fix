## [V45] 
Fixes mimic / masked bug where you can't look around after the kill is interrupted.   
Also removes red screen overlay when the kill is interrupted.

## [V47/V48/V49] 
The fix mentioned above have been implemented in the game, but without the second part (there is a new bug).
If you will get to a point where your screen becomes half red (vomit animation), it will not be removed until you die.
This mod still fixes that part.
